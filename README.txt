Game class - Text Adventure

In this game, one person is randomly spawned into a 5x5 grid and moves from room to room in a dungeon using commands until arriving upon the winning room or dying in a death room. There are warnings when the death room is one square away in the four cardinal directions, and a message when the user tries to move beyond the borders of the grid.

Serialization: scores by players are stored into a leaderboard hashmap which is saved across multiple playthroughs using serialization in "ScoreState.ser" and even after the user types 'q' to quit the program.
